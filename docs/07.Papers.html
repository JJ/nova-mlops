<h1 id="deploy-to-paper">Deploy-to-paper</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Data science and MLOps is very amenable to the creation of workflows that end with a continuously updated paper, poster or presentation. We will see in this last chapter how to do it.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes-of-this-unit">Learning outcomes of this unit</h2>
<p>Integrate ML workflow results in a report or paper that will be continuously updated when data changes. At least an example of such type of languages and tools will be learned.</p>
<h2 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance criteria</h2>
<p>The updatable paper needs to be created, with workflows that trigger their change.</p>
<h2 id="active-publishing-artifacts">“Active” publishing artifacts</h2>
<p>One of the possible ways of deploying a workflow is creating a continuosly-updated paper that is uploaded to GitHub or somewhere else. There are several technologies that can be employed for that, but one of the simplest is R Markdown, which is the one that is being used for this material.</p>
<p>In general, weaving text with code is called <em>literary programming</em>; in general also, how it works is by using tools called <em>weave</em> or <em>unweave</em> that pre-process the source, run the code and capture output to integrate it in the paper, and the final compilation of all source, original and generated, into a single <em>artefact</em> that can be a paper or can include <em>active</em> elements like interactive charts or even running programs.</p>
<p>The use case for this kind of artefact is, within the realm of open science, create non-static papers that present, visualize or even run whole workflows under request.</p>
