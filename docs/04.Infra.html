<h1 id="programming-infrastructure-for-mlops">Programming infrastructure for MLOps</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>MLOps tries to create continuously deployable workflows, and that requires tests, checks and scripts chained that will be run in a CI/CD environment. We will learn how to work with these, focusing in the most popular tool nowadays, GitHub Actions.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes-of-this-unit">Learning outcomes of this unit</h2>
<p>The student will learn different concepts associated with CI/CD workflows, and will be able to create their own using GitHub actions.</p>
<h2 id="cicd-for-the-masses">CI/CD for the masses</h2>
<p>In most cases, cloud providers and software as a service companies will try to offer you a full-span solution, where you will have to pay every step of the way.</p>
<p>In general, however, creating MLOps workflows can be done easily and for free if you are working with free software.</p>
<p>MLOps, in general, is strongly related to the movement for public money, public software, as well as open science. So working in public repositories is the right thing to do if you are in Academia; it is probably a very good idea if you are in industry and you are not working with proprietary data sets.</p>
