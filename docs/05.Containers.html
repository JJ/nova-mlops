<h1 id="reproducible-science-using-containers">Reproducible science using containers</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>In an open science context, containers are not only good for registering the infrastructure in MLOps, but also because they can be easily published and enable anyone to re-use them. We will see best practices in the creation of <em>active</em> and data containers that can be easily used in ML workflows.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes-of-this-unit">Learning outcomes of this unit</h2>
<p>Students will learn how to use containers for deployment of models, as well as to store and possibly publish data.</p>
<h2 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance criteria</h2>
<p>Several data and active containers have been created and integrated into the publishing schedule as well as different workflows.</p>
<h2 id="containers">Containers</h2>
<p>Containers were one of the factors that brought the DevOps (quasi) revolution to the development world. The fact that they allowed to isolate the execution of some programs or services, that they could be packaged and stored, but also that they included a language that allowed very easily to describe how to create them, was a real stunner.</p>

<p>The book Docker for Data Science is a good reference (Cook 2017)</p>
