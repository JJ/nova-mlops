# Third session

We will need to find out how to put our existing procedures to test,
and start writing our first workflows using GitHub actions.

## Session objectives

- Understand git as a workflow manager and how it differentiates from
  GitHub.
- Understand the importance of best practices in programming.
- Understand how to manage dependencies and tasks in ML workflows.
- Learn to create the first tests.
- Create workflows to automate parts of the pipeline.

## By the end of the session

Students will have automated different stages as GitHub actions.

   2. What workflows mean in general.
   3. What is a tag and how to use it.
3. Slack time to finish milestone.
4. Start arranging the code for testing; describing infrastructure.
5. Write tests.
