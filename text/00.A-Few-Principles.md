# A few guiding principles

These are a few principles behind this course, and how it is taught. They are
written here explicitly for a bit of background on the rest of the material.

1. No single language can span all necessary techniques needed to
   become a developer (in data science or anywhere else). Same applies to any
   tool; you need to have the skill to choose the right tool for the job, not a
   single tool.
2. Reproducibility implies following best practices in DevOps, like
   configuration in the environment
3. Always add value to the customer by never losing track of the
   problem that is being solved.
4. Reproducibility begs free software; if a MLOps workflow is tied to specific
   companies and tools reproducibility will suffer (or simply be impossible).
5. MLOps is DevOps, which is about acquiring knowledge to define insfrascture
   and tests for deployed applications.
6. When in doubt, be agile.
