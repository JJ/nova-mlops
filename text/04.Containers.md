# Reproducible science using containers

## TL;DR

In an open science context, containers are not only good for
registering the infrastructure in MLOps, but also because they can be
easily published and enable anyone to re-use them. We will see best
practices in the creation of *active* and data containers that can be
easily used in ML workflows.

## Learning outcomes of this unit

Students will learn how to use containers for deployment of models, as well as
to store and possibly publish data.

## Acceptance criteria

Several data and active containers have been created and integrated into the
publishing schedule as well as different workflows.

## Containers

Containers were one of the factors that brought the DevOps (quasi)
revolution to the software engineering world. The fact that they allowed to
isolate the execution of some programs or services, that they could be
packaged and stored, but also that they included a language that
allowed very easily to describe how to create them, was a real stunner.

Essentially, those are the three factors that make them useful also
for data science: you can isolate an application from the rest of the
system, in such a way that it is very easy to deploy it anywhere; that
isolation comes at the price of precisely describing the
infraestructure that will be needed for running that application. But
the prize is that once that is done, you can deploy your application,
be it a MLOps stage, or even data, wherever you want.

Let's check out the concepts that go together with containers, or
Docker containers as they are called, since that was the company that
created and released the framework for using them in the first place.

First and foremost, what containers do is to *isolate* applications,
not virtualize services. The applications will still use the services
of the host operating system, mainly related to that isolation. Which
services does not matter too much, what matters is that the operating
system must have support for them, and so far only Linux, Windows and
some other IBM operating systems do. Also, they do not virtualize the
processor instruction set, they run executables on the host
processor. That implies that you will need a specific combination of
operating system and processor architecture in the host to run a
container (and the other way round).

However, containers are a standard (from OCI, open container
initiative) and attempt to create a system that any developer can use
and that can be then deployed anywhere. How does that work? The
software you download on the operating system has two parts:

- The command line, or graphical front end, which obviously works on
  your machine as a native program. This is used mainly for
  management.
- The service or daemon, which runs with privileges, and which
  connects to the client through a socket. This means that the service
  can, in principle, run anywhere, as long as you connect to it. This
  service also acts as *registry*, holding a list of your
  containers. This can be a virtual machine, and it is how it works on
  Macs (whose operating system has no support for isolation) and in
  Windows (where you will very probably create containers for Linux
  anyway).
  
Let's see different states a container can be in.

- You create a container usually through a Dockerfile, at least in
  this context (it can be created interactively, but except for
  prototyping, it's not really advised to do so). This Dockerfile has
  specific commands to copy files, run scripts, and define what will
  be run when the image is invoked.
- From the Dockerfile, you build an *image*; this process is similar
  to compiling to a runnable file, and it creates a file that can be
  downloaded and run using any Docker client you have.
- Finally, a *container* is the equivalent of a running executable. It
  receives commands, or runs and exits.
  
The general best practice is to use Dockerfiles in your project to
create images, that are stored in registries (Docker Hub, GitHub
Container Registry, Quay.io)

Good thing about containers is that you have a wide array of them to
be used directly. All containers are built from a base, and these
bases are published in registries, so you can just look for one and
start executing it. 

> At this point, you should have an installation of Docker in your
> machine. Please follow instructions for your specific platform. In
> general we will working with Linux/Intel containers, so if your

For instance, we can start running a Jupyter Hub just by doing this:

```shell
docker run --rm opendatacube/jupyterhub  jupyterhub --ip="*"
```

> There's probably a GUI option to do more or less the same.

The first part, `docker run`, is what effectively tells the service we
are going to run a container; this will also check if the container is
already in our machine, and download it if it is not. You will see
that it will show a message about pulling, and several hexadecimal
hashes that represents the different layers that compose the image. It
does not really matter a lot right now, but best practices advise to
minimize the amount of layers you use.

The rest of the command line is as follows

- `--rm` will delete the container when you've finished running
  it. This is a very convenient way to not have lots of stopped
  containers in your local hard disk, and it's the usual way to do
  this. It will still keep tne *image* so that you will not have to
  download it again (in fact, it will store the *layers*, so it will
  speed up downloading for images that *depend* on this one).
- `opendatacube/jupyterhub` this is the name of the image, usually
  composed by a namespace (or publishers) and a specific name for the
  image; it can be followed by a tag in the shape `:tag`.
- `jupyterhub --ip='*'` is a command you issue, or an argument you
  give the "executable" contained there.
