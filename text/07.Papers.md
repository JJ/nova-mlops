# Deploy-to-paper

## TL;DR

Data science and MLOps is very amenable to the creation of workflows that end
with a continuously updated paper, poster or presentation. We will see in this
last chapter how to do it.

## Learning outcomes of this unit

Integrate ML workflow results in a report or paper that will be continuously
updated when data changes. At least an example of such type of languages and
tools will be learned.

## Acceptance criteria

The updatable paper needs to be created, with workflows that trigger their
change.

## "Active" publishing artifacts

One of the possible ways of deploying a workflow is creating a
continuosly-updated paper that is uploaded to GitHub or somewhere else. There
are several technologies that can be employed for that, but one of the simplest
is R Markdown, which is the one that is being used for this material.

In general, weaving text with code is called *literary programming*; in general
also, how it works is by using tools called *weave* or *unweave* that
pre-process the source, run the code and capture output to integrate it in the
paper, and the final compilation of all source, original and generated, into a
single *artefact* that can be a paper or can include *active* elements like
interactive charts or even running programs.

The use case for this kind of artefact is, within the realm of open science,
create non-static papers that present, visualize or even run whole workflows
under request.

### Example: plot UKR invasion APV losses

```{r tanks}
library("arrow")
df <- read_parquet("../data/ukr-mod-data.parquet")
summary(df)
```
