# MLOps tools

## TL;DR

Install and use MLflow or other tools such as NeptuneAI.

## Learning outcomes of this unit

By the end of this session the concept of MLOps tools and how to put them to
work will have been assimilated and applied by students. The student
will know how to build, save and publish models to registries so that
they can, later, be used or deployed in any environment.

## Acceptance criteria

The student will have added baseline MLOps tools to their workflows
and deployed at least a model.

## MLOps tools

First thing you should be aware is that using MLOps tools is not equivalent to
MLOps. MLOps is a philosophy, one that we have tried to convey through this
whole course. Obviously, tools are important.

## Assignment

Use some MLOps tool such as MLflow and/or NeptuneAI to create and
control an experiment. If possible, integrate it with the other
workflows so that training is performed automatically when data
changes.
