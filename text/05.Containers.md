# Reproducible science using containers

## TL;DR

In an open science context, containers are not only good for
registering the infrastructure in MLOps, but also because they can be
easily published and enable anyone to re-use them. We will see best
practices in the creation of *active* and data containers that can be
easily used in ML workflows.

## Learning outcomes of this unit

Students will learn how to use containers for deployment of models, as well as
to store and possibly publish data.

## Containers

Containers were one of the factors that brought the DevOps (quasi)
revolution to the development world. The fact that they allowed to
isolate the execution of some programs or services, that they could be
packaged and stored, but also that they included a language that
allowed very easily to describe how to create them, was a real stunner.
